# AI Agent Roadmap 🚀

This repository documents the **step-by-step journey** of building a personal AI Agent system — from planning, journaling daily progress, and drafting roadmaps, to implementation.

## 📌 Project Structure
- `journal.txt` → Daily progress log (chronological, raw thoughts & actions).
- `roadmap/` → Checklists, A–Z roadmap templates, and detailed milestones.
- `README.md` → This guide (overview & usage).
- `.gitignore` → Keeps repo clean by ignoring unnecessary files.

## 🗓 Journal
See [journal.txt](./journal.txt) for the daily log of activities.  
Day 1 started with:
- Initial repo setup
- Creating `journal.txt` (with first entry)
- Drafting `roadmap/` folder with templates

## 🎯 Roadmap
See the [roadmap/](./roadmap/) folder for the A–Z structured plan.

# AI Agent Roadmap

This repository documents the journey of building and deploying **AI Agent Teams** — from scratch to production-ready systems.  
It is both a **personal journal** and a **step-by-step roadmap** designed to grow day by day.

## Structure
- **journal.txt** — Daily log of progress, reflections, and learnings.
- **roadmap/** — Contains sprint plans and templates.
  - `week-1.md`, `week-2.md`, ... — Sprint-focused tasks.
  - `template.md` — Base structure for new sprints.

## Goals
1. Build autonomous **AI Developer Agents** to assist with coding tasks.
2. Build autonomous **AI Content Agents** to create, refine, and manage content.
3. Expand into a **multi-agent orchestration system** that can be reused across projects.

## Usage
This repo is not (yet) a software package. It is a **working log** you can follow or fork to structure your own AI Agent project.
