## Day 3: Roadmap Kickoff

**Date:** [Insert today’s date]

### Progress
- Added `roadmap/week-1.md` with starter sprint goals.
- Established the first sprint focus (Week 1).
- Clarified sprint goals: repository setup, journal discipline, and agent design planning.
- Defined two core agent roles to flesh out this week:
  1. AI Developer Agent
  2. AI Content Agent

### Reflections
Today marks the shift from setup into execution.  
Instead of just scaffolding, I now have a clear **week-long sprint** that ties into my bigger vision.  
The feeling is that of building a live organism — each day the repo grows a new piece.

### Next Steps
- Commit README.md and .gitignore (still pending).
- Expand details for the AI Developer Agent (Day 4).
- Expand details for the AI Content Agent (Day 5).
- Keep journal and roadmap evolving in sync.


=== Day 4: Week 2 Kickoff ===
Date: 2025-09-08

Today marks the transition from groundwork into actual build mode.
We will start enhancing the agent scripts and prepare Laravel as the hub.
The goal for this week is to have structured task logs, richer reports,
and a seeded Laravel project environment.

Feeling: Motivated. The project now feels alive and moving!



Day 6 — Closing the Polishing Phase

Today we wrapped up the polishing cycle for the logging + reporting tools:

1. Agent logging is now global via `agentlog`, supporting status overrides
   (completed, failed, pending, etc.).
2. Reporting (`report`) has matured into a mini-dashboard:
   - Full/filtered logs
   - Daily summaries
   - Tabular breakdown by agent + status
   - Color-coded, date-filtered output
   - Global flags like `--summary-only`, `--since YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Export system is complete:
   - Auto-naming fallback with date+timestamp
   - Default output to `exports/` folder
   - Custom filenames supported
   - Cleanup flag (`--clean-exports`) wipes all exports on demand

This closes Phase 1: the “Groundwork + Polishing” stage. The system now feels stable, usable, and extensible.

Next: we move into Phase 2 (Real Agent Behaviors). The groundwork we laid ensures logs, reporting, and exports are already production-ready.

Day 7 — Phase 2 Kickoff: Agent Roles + BrainBox Orchestration

Today we opened Phase 2 of the AI Agent Team project.

✅ Objective:
- Transition from tooling/polishing into real multi-agent behaviors.
- Begin shaping distinct agent roles (Developer, Content).
- Introduce BrainBox as the orchestrator layer.

🎯 Actions Taken:
- Defined Phase 2 focus: move from logging utilities into true agent collaboration.
- Seeded roadmap for Week 3 sprint (Agent Roles + BrainBox).
- Established plan for BrainBox to route tasks to different agents.

📝 Notes:
Phase 1 gave us a rock-solid base: logs, reports, exports, cleanup.  
Phase 2 will bring life to the agents themselves. We’re no longer polishing tools — we’re animating them.

⚡ Blockers:
- None yet. Need to carefully scope BrainBox responsibilities.

🔮 Next Steps (Day 8+):
- Implement role-based agent stubs (DevAgent, ContentAgent).
- Draft BrainBox manager to dispatch tasks.
- Test simple collaboration flow: BrainBox assigns -> Agent executes -> Log records.

Day 7 — Phase 2 Kickoff: First BrainBox Milestone

Today marks the first real milestone of Phase 2: BrainBox has been born.

✅ Objective:
- Implement the first version of BrainBox (task dispatcher).
- Allow BrainBox to send tasks to DevAgent or ContentAgent.
- Ensure BrainBox integrates with the logging system.

🎯 Actions Taken:
- Created `agents/brainbox.php`.
- BrainBox now accepts CLI input: 
    php agents/brainbox.php DevAgent "Initialize Laravel project"
    php agents/brainbox.php ContentAgent "Write setup documentation"
- Dispatches tasks with `status: dispatched` and `source: BrainBox`.
- Simulates agent responses (to be replaced with real stubs soon).
- Logs everything into the shared `agent-log.jsonl`.

📝 Notes:
- This is the first time BrainBox is acting as an orchestrator.
- Right now it only simulates agent responses, but logging + routing is solid.
- The project has officially moved from “tools” to “behaviors.”

⚡ Blockers:
- Need to expand agents into true role-based scripts.
- BrainBox should eventually call actual agent scripts instead of simulating.

🔮 Next Steps (Day 8+):
- Expand DevAgent and ContentAgent stubs.
- Teach BrainBox to route real work to them.
- Run first end-to-end test where BrainBox assigns a Dev task and a Content task, both get logged and reported.

-------------------------------
DAY 8 – FIRST REAL AGENT EXECUTIONS
-------------------------------

📅 Date: [Insert today’s date]

✅ Objective:
- Move beyond simulation into real agent execution.
- Have BrainBox route tasks to agent stubs (`DevAgent.php` and `ContentAgent.php`).
- Ensure dispatch is always logged, even if an agent script is missing.

🎯 Actions Taken:
- Created `DevAgent.php` and `ContentAgent.php` stubs as the first callable agents.
- Updated `brainbox.php` so that:
  - Dispatch is logged *before* execution.
  - Fallback console output shows ⚠️ when a script is missing.
- Confirmed BrainBox can now:
  - Dispatch to DevAgent (e.g., “Initialize Laravel project”).
  - Dispatch to ContentAgent (e.g., “Write setup documentation”).
- Verified logs show “dispatched” entries regardless of success/failure.

📝 Notes:
- This milestone marks the **transition from groundwork to living agents**.
- Each agent is still minimal, but BrainBox is now truly orchestrating multiple workers.
- Logging-first ensures reliability and audit trail.

⚡ Blockers:
- None yet — agents are stubs, so no actual Laravel or content tasks executed.

🔮 Next Steps (Day 9):
- Flesh out DevAgent with a real Laravel init routine.
- Flesh out ContentAgent with a first doc-writing task.
- Extend BrainBox with agent registry/config file.

No more polishing here: we’ve set a “stable CLI foundation.”

⚡ Blockers

None. All desired CLI refinements achieved.

🔮 Next Steps

Begin Phase 2.1: migrate reporting into SB Admin 2 UI.

-------------------------------
DAY 9 – CLI PHASE 2 COMPLETE
-------------------------------

📅 Date: 2025-09-12

✅ Objective:
- Finalize all CLI-side tooling before transitioning to UI.
- Ensure logs, reports, exports, cleanup, and stats are stable and feature-complete.

🎯 Actions Taken:
- Completed refinements to `report.php`:
  - Grouped Activity Reports by agent with color + icon signals.
  - Added `--collapse` for condensed summaries.
  - Added `--stats` KPI dashboard with traffic-light coloring.
  - Added `--clean-exports` with safeguard prompt.
  - Auto-naming for CSV/JSON exports.
- Confirmed CLI phase stability with final test runs (collapse, stats, export).

📝 Notes:
- This marks the *closure of CLI development* — the reporting system is now rich and audit-ready.
- Every command provides clear, colorized feedback for quick scanning.
- From here, the CLI will be maintained as a backend utility while the Laravel UI grows on top.

⚡ Blockers:
- None. CLI phase considered complete.

🔮 Next Steps (Day 10):
- Transition into Laravel dashboard (SB Admin 2 Bootstrap 5).
- Scaffold sidebar, topbar, footer.
- Wire dashboard cards with live log stats.

-------------------------------
DAY 10 – LARAVEL DASHBOARD BIRTH
-------------------------------

📅 Date: 2025-09-13

✅ Objective:
- Launch the visual frontend for the AI Agent Team system.
- Connect CLI logs into a clean Bootstrap dashboard.

🎯 Actions Taken:
- Installed Laravel project under `/ai-agent-dashboard`.
- Integrated SB Admin 2 (Bootstrap 5) as the UI template.
- Scaffolded layout: sidebar, topbar, footer.
- Built first dashboard view:
  - Cards for **Total Tasks, Completed, Failed, Pending**.
  - Pie chart placeholder (Chart.js).
- Created Reports module:
  - Blade table with logs from `agent-log.jsonl`.
  - Colorized rows and badges by status.
  - Filters: status buttons, search bar, quick date ranges, from/to picker.
  - Live counter for visible tasks.
  - Export to CSV/JSON (filtered subset only).
  - Toast notifications for successful exports.

📝 Notes:
- This is the **first visual milestone**: the system feels like a product, not just scripts.
- Filters and exports work live without page reloads.
- Agents’ logs are now both CLI-readable and visually explorable.

⚡ Blockers:
- Chart.js rendering still needs polish (not blocking).
- Repo split: Laravel UI is outside the `/ai-agent-roadmap` repo; needs monorepo merge.

🔮 Next Steps (Day 11):
- Create **Agents page** to list all registered agents (DevAgent, ContentAgent, future).
- Show their status, last activity, and simple management controls.
- Sync Laravel repo into main GitHub project for unified history.

- ContentAgent is officially live in the system as a placeholder; next steps will flesh it out with real task handling.
- This is the first step toward multi-agent workflows.

⚡ Blockers:
- None major. Just need to wire ContentAgent outputs into dashboard viewer.

🔮 Next Steps (Day 12):
- Implement ContentAgent’s first real task: “Summarize last 10 logs”.
- Save output as Markdown file in `/content/`.
- Add modal viewer in dashboard for generated docs.
- Plan cross-agent flow: auto-generate README after DevAgent scaffolds.
