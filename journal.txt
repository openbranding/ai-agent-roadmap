## Day 3: Roadmap Kickoff

**Date:** [Insert today’s date]

### Progress
- Added `roadmap/week-1.md` with starter sprint goals.
- Established the first sprint focus (Week 1).
- Clarified sprint goals: repository setup, journal discipline, and agent design planning.
- Defined two core agent roles to flesh out this week:
  1. AI Developer Agent
  2. AI Content Agent

### Reflections
Today marks the shift from setup into execution.  
Instead of just scaffolding, I now have a clear **week-long sprint** that ties into my bigger vision.  
The feeling is that of building a live organism — each day the repo grows a new piece.

### Next Steps
- Commit README.md and .gitignore (still pending).
- Expand details for the AI Developer Agent (Day 4).
- Expand details for the AI Content Agent (Day 5).
- Keep journal and roadmap evolving in sync.
