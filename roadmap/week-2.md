# Week 2 — Agent Foundations

✅ **Goal**: Move from text-based logs to structured data, and seed the Laravel base.

## Tasks
- [ ] Upgrade `agent_stub.php` to log tasks in JSON format (`logs/agent-log.jsonl`)
- [ ] Extend `report.php` with:
  - [ ] Filter by agent name
  - [ ] Filter by date range
  - [ ] Pretty-print JSON log results
- [ ] Seed Laravel base project (scaffold only)
- [ ] Document setup steps in `README.md`
- [ ] Commit `.env.example` for Laravel
- [ ] Plan Week 3: Multi-agent collaboration

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Create a `tools/` folder for helper scripts
- [ ] Add an error log handler
- [ ] First experiment: let DevAgent “call” another agent (stub-to-stub)
