# Week 3 — Agent Roles + BrainBox

✅ **Goal**: Shift from infrastructure into real agent behaviors.

## Tasks
- [ ] Extend `agent_stub.php` into multiple role-based agents:
  - [ ] DevAgent (coding, scaffolding tasks)
  - [ ] ContentAgent (writing, docs, explanations)
- [ ] Create `brainbox.php` as the orchestrator:
  - [ ] Parse command/input
  - [ ] Decide which agent to assign
  - [ ] Collect and log response
- [ ] Integrate BrainBox with existing log + report system
- [ ] Journal + roadmap updated daily

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Add ability for BrainBox to “chain” tasks between agents
- [ ] First cross-agent test (e.g., DevAgent builds stub, ContentAgent documents it)
- [ ] Plan Week 4: expanding team roles (e.g., TestAgent, ResearchAgent)

### End of Week 3 Target
- Agents can receive tasks from BrainBox and log their outputs.
- Reports reflect role-specific activity.
- First demo: BrainBox instructs both DevAgent and ContentAgent in one flow.
